Tasks to specialize the USP protocol agent (ccsp-usp-pa) for a particular
deployment:

1. In 'usp_factory_reset.conf' (the factory reset settings for ccsp-usp-pa), 
you must specify the controller with the  data model parameters:

Device.LocalAgent.Controller.1.EndpointID
Device.STOMP.Connection.1.Host
Device.STOMP.Connection.1.Username
Device.STOMP.Connection.1.Password

2. The ManufacturerOUI and SerialNumber should be set correctly by the usual
mechanisms in RDK. In the default RDK build, they may contain invalid values.

3. If "Device.LocalAgent.EndpointID" has been overridden in 
'usp_factory_reset.conf', before deployment, this should be removed, in order
that each device has a unique EndpointID (defined by ManufacturerOUI and 
SerialNumber).

4. In usp_truststore.conf put all PEM formatted certificates of the Certificate
Authorities that are used to validate the controller certificates.

5. In ccsp-usp-pa.service, the amount of debug logging to syslog may be altered
using the '-p' and '-v' flags.

6. The data model provider components must be specified in usp_dm_comps.conf.
This file has 3 columns:
(a) Short name for the component (for reference by the other data model config
    files)
(b) Component name of the component
(c) D-Bus path name of the component

7. The data model objects (from provider components) accessible over USP must
be specified in usp_dm_objs.conf. This file has 3 columns:
(a) Data model path for the object
(b) Short name of the component providing this object
(c) Whether the object is writable ('RW') or read-only ('RO'). Writable objects
allow a USP contrller to add or delete instances. Read-only objects have 
instances which are controlled only by the device.

8. The data model parameters (from provider components) accessible over USP must
be specified in usp_dm_params.conf. This file has 4 columns:
(a) Data model path for the parameter
(b) Short name of the component providing this parameter
(c) Type of the parameter. Example: STRING, BOOL, INT, UINT, ULONG, DATETIME
(d) Whether the parameter is writable ('RW') or read-only ('RO').

9. If some parameters or objects in the data model config files are spelt 
incorrectly or do not exist anymore this may cause other parameters obtained
in a group with the same provider component to fail. 
To discover and update the supported data model config files, first delete
the config files on the device, then restart the USP protocol agent. When 
starting, the USP protocol agent will discover the supported data model and 
write the config files. This process takes appproximately a minute and is 
quite processor intensive, so it is recommended to deploy with pre-defined
config files.

10. Passwords may be specified either in usp_factory_reset.conf, and
obfuscated in the database using the PASSWORD_OBFUSCATION_KEY in vendor_defs.h,
or programmatically by registering a callback in vendor.c. It is recommended
to use a callback and store passwords in a device-specific, secure way.
